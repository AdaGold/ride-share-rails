# Rideshare Rails

<!-- Instructors: The checkmarks are already there, so just delete them for any line items that aren't met. -->

## Major Learning Goals/Code Review

<!-- Instructors: Feel free to practice creating specific feedback by referencing a line of code if you'd like. For example, you may say something like "nice custom method in `calculator.rb` line 42." This is optional. -->

<!-- 
Reflection Q answers:

Describe the types of entity relationships you set up in your project and why you set up the relationships that way:
Driver - Trip: One to many
Passenger - Trip: One to many

Describe the role of model validations in your application:
Prevents db from saving invalid data. May mention user experience.

All other questions are qualitative.
